# Round Robin Pairings

This program generates round-robin pairings for a chess tournament with 2^n players.

The program will prompt the user for a text file containing the names of the players in the tournament. Please see
example.txt for correct formatting of your text file. Currently, the program will simply print the pairings to the
console, but ultimately, the goal is for the program to write the pairings to a text file.
