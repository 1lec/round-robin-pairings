# Round Robin Pairings

This program generates round-robin pairings for a chess tournament with 2^n number of players. The program can also
pair events with even, non-2^n numbers of players, but not with 100% success.

The program will prompt the user for a text file containing the names of the players in the tournament. Please see
one of the example text files to understand the correct formatting of this text file. Once the pairings are
generated, the program prompt the user for a location to save them.
