# Round Robin Pairings

This program generates pairings for a single round-robin chess tournament with an even number of players.

The program will ask you for a text file containing the names of all players in the tournament. Please make sure your
file follows the same format as example.txt. Once pairings for your event are generated, you will be prompted to save
them to a file on your device.
